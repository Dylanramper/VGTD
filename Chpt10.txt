  a.
    There is a low risk that this will slow the development time because it is
    unlikely that the new version of the OS will get in the way of players being

  b.
    An artist leaving the team after 2 months is a low risk because, as stated, 
    they had done half of the animations and artwork. There would be enough time
    to look for a new artist to pick up where the previous one left off.

  c.
    This is a high risk to the project. If none of the programmers show up in over

    doomed. (No pun intended)
