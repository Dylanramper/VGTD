   I would likely choose the waterfall model because since I would be working on a simple 2D mobile game the
   waterfall model seems to be everything you would need for it. It's simple enough for the whole team to 
   understand and the game itself would benefit in crunch time since we wont be taking up too much time 
   trying to hard to plan out the entire model.
