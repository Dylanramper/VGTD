2.
  a. -Catalyst Wars
     -The game doesn't sound like it needs a singleplayer mode. (Would get boring)
     -Overall concept is boring
     -Unoriginality
     -No key features are emphesized
     -No table of contents
     -No control layout
     -No initial budget
     -The production time say they plan to have framework implemented by 1998, but the document is dated for 2007.
     -Ideas use a lot of outdated ideas and methods. (using emails and LAN files to play with friends)
     -Story does not provide a lot of background information

If the game had ran on a better engine, they could have taken out the singleplayer feature and added the scenario
mode as a seperate gamemode on the title screen. Having it run on a better engine would remove the need to access
matches via email or LAN. It would also cut the wait time of a match so you wouldn't have to wait 5 minutes as is
stated in the document.

     -Flying
     -Game's title was not was not displayed in the first page.
     -Sloppy discriptions of story, history of the world and game's goal. (Painful to read)
     -No table of contents
     -List of characters are poorly iterated and too short.
     -No current engine picked for the game.
     -Overall boring concept for a game.
     -No budget.
     -No intended dates of production.

Overhall the entire concept behind the game. Rewrite the document so that it's more professional and redo the
concept of the story and expand. Also add a wider history as to why there are people with wings and why there 
aren't and why the people with wings have to protect everything within the world. Add more of a backstory behind
the world for example; maybe there's a war going on between a race of creatures that live on floating islands and
the people that live on the surface. This game needs to go back to the drawing board.


  b. -Claw
     -Contains table of contents
     -Shows system requirments
     -Clearly explains the setup procedure
     -Shows a table of the control schieme
     -Step-by-step discription of how to set up, load and save a game.
     -Has images as references for power ups and items.
     -Shows updates made to the document as aposed to completely removing an idea

This GDD is a good design because it has the table of contents, the controls, the setup process and images as 
reference. This GDD knows it's target audience and does not stray away from it's genre too much. It stays true
what it's goal is and it is easy to understand.

     -DOOM
     -Has a demo planned that is laydout.
     -Clearly outlines the character and gives a brief description of them.
     -Has laydout scripts for levels or "Episodes".
     -Has plenty of crossover potential.
     -Has descriptions of what each level will look like.
     -Has pictures to provide along with description.
     
This game sounds like it has amazing potential. The person seems to have a steady plan and the ideas don't seem
too far fetched.


  c.Old docs vs. new docs

What remains: They still include the controls just in a differen't layout. They have step-by-step
              procedures on the controls and start up screens. They still have list of system 
              requirements. 

What doesn't: The older docs tend to describe more with coding. unlike today's GDDs, the old docs don't tend to
     have a story outline either. The new docs are more organized and neat. They include target audience, world
     history, character background and pictures as reference.The older Docs also use pens to fix mistakes or add
     ideas to an existing doc and there is no table of contents in the old docs.
